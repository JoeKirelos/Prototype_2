main design question : is this mechanic easy to figure out and is it engaging in way of repetition to mastery ?
should there be a tutorial or should it be kept cryptic ?
should acceleration be removed to make the game easier ?
playtest notes:
feedback as to what could be added. a tutorial, can be cryptic but easier or can be explicit about the controls as the game is already difficult can add a highlight to show where the last checkpoint was. (for an easy mode option) most people like the difficulty the acceleration adds one player discovered a new mechanic that emerged from the exitent game elements. if a player saves at the very bottom, they get a full jump as acceleration doesn't ramp up as fast.
answer to main design question. it isn't easy to figure out, but it does contain that repetition to mastery aesthetic.
